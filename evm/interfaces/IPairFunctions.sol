/// @dev Implement this interface to support propeller routing through your pairs.
/// @dev Before implementing the interface we need to introduce three function for a
/// @dev given pair: The swap(x), gas(x) and price(x) functions:
/// @dev The swap function accepts some specified token amount: x and returns the
/// @dev amount y a user can get by swapping x through the venue.
/// @dev The gas function simply returns the estimated gas cost given a specified
/// @dev amount x.
/// @dev Last but not least, the price function is the derivative of the swap
/// @dev function. It represents the best possible price a user can get from a
/// @dev pair after swapping x of the specified token.
/// @dev During calls to price, swap and getLimits, the caller can be assumed to
/// @dev have the required sell or buy token balance as well as unlimited approvals
/// @dev to this contract.
